## Project Overview

Sideway is a collaborative content-idea marketplace with on-chain attribution and revenue sharing via content coins. It enables creators to post content ideas, invite collaborators dynamically, manage workflow & attribution, and automatically split revenue in ZORA tokens by leveraging Zora Labs's Coins Protocol.

### Key Features

- **Dynamic Collaborator Onboarding**: Creators start with 100% stake and can add collaborators later
- **Automatic Revenue Sharing**: Revenue flows automatically through split contracts
- **On-chain Attribution**: All shares and payments are recorded on-chain
- **ZORA Token Integration**: Revenue is distributed in ZORA tokens
- **Content Coin Minting**: Ideas are represented as tradeable content coins
