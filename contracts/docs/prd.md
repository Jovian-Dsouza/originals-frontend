# Product Requirements Document (PRD) â€“ Sideway

## Executive Summary

**Tagline**: A collaborative content-idea marketplace with on-chain attribution and revenue sharing via content coins.

**Goal**: Enable creators to post content ideas, invite collaborators dynamically, manage workflow & attribution, and automatically split revenue (in ZORA tokens) by leveraging Zora Labs's Coins Protocol.

## 1. Background & Opportunity

### Problem Statement

Creators frequently have content ideas requiring collaborators (writers, editors, producers), yet managing who gets what share, handling attribution, and distributing revenue is messy and often off-chain. Current solutions lack transparency, automation, and fair revenue distribution mechanisms.

### Solution Overview

Sideway's model starts with creator owning 100% stake, then as collaborators come on board they receive portions of the creator's stake. Revenue is paid in ZORA tokens and the payout recipient of the coin is set to a split contract at minting.

This gives creators flexibility to bring on collaborators after idea posting, and ensures that the on-chain payout flow is automatic from the start (no separate manual routing).

### Market Opportunity

- Growing creator economy with increasing collaboration needs
- Web3-native creators seeking transparent, automated revenue sharing
- Demand for on-chain attribution and immutable payment records
- Integration with established protocols like Zora Labs

## 2. High-Level User Journey

### Creator Path

1. **Connect wallet, create idea post**
   - A content coin is minted via Zora SDK/factory with payoutRecipient set to a new split contract (which currently assigns 100% to the creator)
   - Metadata for the idea (title, description, collateral, collaborator slot count) is stored (e.g., IPFS URI)
   - Idea appears on Sideway marketplace as "open for collaborators"
   - Creator currently has 100% stake

2. **Collaborator Selection**
   - Collaborators browse idea feed, swipe, match
   - Creator selects collaborator(s)
   - For each selected:
     - Off-chain agreement or UI flow to set share percentage (from creator's 100%)
     - On-chain: update the split contract to reflect new distribution
     - Creator's share reduces accordingly, collaborator's share is set
     - Optionally: update the content coin's payoutRecipient (still same contract so revenue routing remains automatic)

3. **Content Creation & Publishing**
   - Work proceeds, content published (credited to creator + collaborators)
   - Revenue (in ZORA tokens) from trading of the coin or other monetisation flows automatically flows to the split contract
   - Revenue splits among creator + collaborators as per shares

4. **Dashboard & Analytics**
   - Dashboard shows each stakeholder's balance, share, payments, and history

### Collaborator Path

1. **Discovery & Application**
   - Connect wallet, browse open ideas
   - Right-swipe/pick idea(s), send interest, await creator's acceptance

2. **Onboarding**
   - Once selected by creator, collaborator's share is recorded on-chain via split contract

3. **Revenue Distribution**
   - After publishing and revenue comes in, collaborator's share of ZORA flows automatically to their wallet via split contract
   - Collaborator can view dashboard for withdrawals or see auto forwarded funds

## 3. Key Features & Requirements

### 3.1 Idea Posting & Content Coin Minting

- **Coin Creation**: At posting time, creator mints via Zora SDK with parameters including creator, name, symbol, metadata.uri, currency = ZORA
- **Payout Recipient**: payoutRecipientOverride is set to address of a freshly deployed split contract owned by creator, initially allocating 100% to creator
- **Metadata Storage**: Idea metadata (title, description, collateral, collaborator slot count) stored on IPFS

### 3.2 Marketplace & Matching Engine

- **Open Feed**: Display of content ideas available for collaboration
- **Swipe Interface**: Collaborators can browse and express interest
- **Creator Selection**: Creator can review and select collaborators

### 3.3 Collaborator Onboarding & Share Assignment

- **Initial State**: Creator has full stake (100%)
- **Dynamic Addition**: When collaborators join, creator assigns a portion of their stake
- **On-chain Updates**: Split contract state changes to reflect new shares
- **Share Management**: Creator can adjust shares and add/remove collaborators

### 3.4 Automatic Payout Recipient Flow

- **Continuous Routing**: Split contract serves as payoutRecipient from coin creation onward
- **Automatic Distribution**: All ZORA token rewards automatically routed to contract and distributed according to shares
- **No Manual Settlement**: Eliminates need for separate manual settlement layer

### 3.5 Revenue Flow & Distribution in ZORA

- **Currency**: Revenue currency is ZORA token (ERC20)
- **Automatic Handling**: System handles ZORA token flows for payout
- **Split Contract**: Handles incoming ZORA token transfers and distributes according to share percentages

### 3.6 Dashboard & Attribution

- **Analytics**: Number of collaborators, share splits, total ZORA received/distributed, pending balance
- **Attribution**: Published content shows creator + collaborator(s) with share percentages
- **History**: Complete transaction and payment history

### 3.7 Share Management

- **Dynamic Updates**: Allow creator to modify distribution to add/remove collaborators
- **Governance**: Audited policy for share changes
- **Transparency**: All changes recorded on-chain with events

## 4. Technical Architecture & Integration

### 4.1 Zora Integration

- **Coin Minting**: Use Zora Coins SDK or factory deploy to mint coin with currency = ZORA
- **Payout Recipient**: Deploy Split Contract (CollaborativePayout) at or before minting with initial share = 100% creator
- **Factory Parameters**: Pass split contract's address as payoutRecipientOverride when calling createCoin

### 4.2 Split Contract Architecture

- **ERC20 Support**: Support ERC20 (ZORA) reception and distribution logic
- **State Management**: Update internal state of split contract (shares array, percentages)
- **Event Emission**: Emit SharesUpdated events for transparency

### 4.3 Revenue Flow

- **Automatic Routing**: Zora protocol sends creator's share of rewards to payoutRecipient (split contract)
- **Distribution**: Split contract distributes or holds for withdrawal
- **Frontend Integration**: Record coin address, split contract address, creator address, collaborator list and shares

### 4.4 Dynamic Management

- **UI Controls**: Allow dynamic add collaborator, set share, trigger on-chain transaction
- **ZORA Handling**: Ensure ZORA token flows (ERC20) are correctly handled
- **Edge Cases**: Handle collaborator declines, wallet changes, departures
